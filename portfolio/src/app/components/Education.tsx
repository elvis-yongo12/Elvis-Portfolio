            I graduated from Modcom Institute of Technology, where I first earned a Degree in Software Development. Building on that foundation, I later pursued and completed a certification in Full Stack Development. This educational journey equipped me with a solid understanding of both the technical and creative aspects of software development, allowing me to become a versatile developer capable of handling front-end, back-end, and everything in between.
