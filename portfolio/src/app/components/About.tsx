            I'm Elvis Odhiambo Yongo, a full-stack developer with a deep passion for building innovative and efficient software solutions. I have experience working across both front-end and back-end development, which allows me to handle projects from start to finish. Whether it's designing user-friendly interfaces or optimizing back-end systems, I enjoy bringing everything together to create applications that perform seamlessly. <br /> <br />

            What drives me is solving complex problems with creative and practical solutions. I’m constantly researching new technologies and trends to stay up-to-date and sharpen my skills, so I can always bring the best to the table in every project I work on. I like to think of programming as more than just writing code—it's about creating something valuable, something that makes a difference. <br /> <br />

            When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me on the football field. It helps me clear my head and keeps me focused. Overall, I’m all about pushing my limits, both in my work as a developer and in life.
